The student had been struggling with feelings of hopelessness and depression following a heartbreak; and had even considered taking his own life. Anne carefully listened to the student and worked with him to find ways to cope with his emotions and overcome his suicidal thoughts. With her guidance and support, the student eventually shared his struggles with his parents and sought further help. This Event led Anne to realize that she has a message the youth today desperately need Anne has gained very unique perspectives on the challenges and obstacles facing today's youth after years and years of mentoring. Through engaging and thought-provoking presentations, she inspires and motivates audiences to take action and make a difference."
